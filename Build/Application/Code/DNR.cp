/*!
Initiates an asynchronous lookup of a host name, which may be
an IPv4 or IPv6 numerical or named address.  Returns
"kDNR_ResultOK" if this succeeded; also, upon success, spawns
a thread that will wait for the lookup to complete.

The thread sleeps until the resolver returns, at which time it
invokes the given block with the "struct hostent*" result of
the completed call.  If this data is "nullptr", the lookup has
failed; otherwise, read the lookup data and finally call
DNR_Dispose() to free it.

If "inRestrictIPv4" is true, then the result will be in IPv4
(traditional) format; otherwise, it will use the IPv6 (longer)
format.

/*!
Creates a string representation of the specified
host address in the structure.  The index is
usually 0, but may be greater if you know that
more than one matching address was found in your
resolver record.

The string representation is going to be an IP
address in version 4 (dotted decimal) or version 6
(colon-delimited hex) form.

A Core Foundation string is returned, since it is
likely you will want to use this for UI purposes
anyway (e.g. display in a text box) and a CFString
is easily converted to a C string, etc. if needed.
You must CFRelease() the string when finished with
it.

Returns nullptr if there is a problem allocating the
new string.
