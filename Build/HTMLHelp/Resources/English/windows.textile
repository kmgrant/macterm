h1(pagetitle). Types of Windows

notextile. <div class="content">

h2(#terminal). Terminal

A terminal window is what you will use most in MacTerm.  It
 displays a primarily-text interface to other applications.

There are so many things you can do with terminal windows that
 there is a "dedicated page":terminals.html discussing them all!

h2(#tek). Tektronix Vector Graphics

MacTerm can render TEK-formatted data as vector graphics.  Before
 attempting this, make sure your session has a TEK graphics command
 set enabled in MacTerm settings (see Sessions >> Graphics), and use
 View >> New TEK Page just before sending TEK-formatted data from
 your session.  Depending on settings, requesting a new page
 might erase any existing window instead of opening a new one.

**Important:** While a graphics window is open, keyboard input to the
 original terminal is tied to the canvas: you must have the terminal
 window active in order to type even though the text will be rendered
 in the graphics window only!  To restore normal terminal behavior,
 close the graphics window.  Note that if you use View >> New TEK Page
 to open windows more than once, only the most recent one is tied to
 the terminal and the others can then stay open indefinitely.

What you can do with a graphics window:

* File >> Print… to print or make a PDF from the graphic at its current zoom level.
* Edit >> Copy to put the graphic at its current zoom level on the clipboard.
* View menu commands to change the Format (colors).  Also, your Default Format is used for graphics when they first appear.
* View >> Enter Full Screen or the corresponding window button (and on later OS versions, you can tile the graphic window side-by-side with something else).
* Window >> Rename… to change the title.
* Resize the window to adjust the image view.
* Focus on one part of the image by dragging a rectangle with the mouse or pinching with a trackpad.  **You can restore the view to 100% zoom by double-clicking the image.**  (Press Escape during a rectangle-drag to cancel the drag.)

h2(#serverbrowser). Server Browser

The Servers panel appears when the "Remote Shell..." button is
 clicked (either in the File >> Custom New Session... sheet, or
 when editing the equivalent panel in the main settings window).
 Changes to the panel will automatically write an appropriate
 command line, in the window whose button was most recently used
 to activate the panel.

What you can do with the Servers panel:

* Browse for any services that were discovered by your computer.
* Enter connection details manually.

A remote application is accessed over a *connection* (which uses
 a particular "protocol") to an exact *port* (number) on a *host*
 (computer).  You can also identify yourself with a *user ID*, if
 the server requires one.

To start, make a selection from the "Connection:" menu.  This
 will automatically assign a default port number.  (You may need
 to ask an administrator which choice is appropriate.)

It may be possible to simply browse for a service instead of
 entering connection details manually.  To try this, click the
 "Find a Server..." button, which will display a drawer that
 begins to list anything that was found by your computer for the
 type of Connection you selected in the menu.  Click any item in
 the list to copy its Host and Port information.  Double-click
 to automatically close the drawer in the process.

If the service you want is not listed, you need to fill in the
 panel manually.  (You may want to ask an administrator for help.)

In the Host field, you can enter a name like "apple.com" if one
 is applicable; if you have only an address, like "123.45.67.123",
 enter that instead.  The Look Up button can be used to check if a
 server name is valid (if so, it is transformed into a numeric
 address; otherwise, it is unchanged).

bq. MacTerm supports IP version 6 addresses too, so
 you could also enter something like
 "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:9d16:0164".

The Port field may not require changing...it is set automatically
 when you choose a Connection type.  But some servers use a custom
 port number, so adjust the value if necessary.

The User ID is how the server identifies you.  If not provided,
 the name of your local Home folder is used (one-word,
 all-lowercase).  Note that if a password is also required to
 access the server, you will be prompted for that at connection
 time; you cannot enter it initially in the configuration sheet.

h2(#sessioninfo). Session Info

Displays the status of all windows at once, including whether or
 not processes are running.  There are icons in the Window menu
 that show similar information.

To bring a window to the front, you can double-click its entry in
 the Session Info list.

To rename a window, select the appropriate item in the list and
 press Return to display an edit box (as you would in the Finder).
 This is equivalent to using the Window >> Rename command.

Hovering the mouse over the Status column can show a few
 different text descriptions:

* **Running (just opened):** It has only been a few seconds since the window opened, so you can close it without warning.
* **Running:** The session has been open for awhile; MacTerm will confirm when you try to close it.
* **Not Running:** The application running in the window has quit, but the window is still open; only possible when you have set the "Don't automatically close windows" setting.

An icon is also displayed, and normally matches the text above;
 but, it can sometimes change to show a transient state:

* A yellow caution icon indicates an open alert message, or that a notification is up (for example, a watch for activity in a window).
* A "dimmed" icon indicates the window was hidden from view with the Hide command.  (Hidden windows can be redisplayed in many ways, including double-clicking Session Info list items.)

You can rearrange the columns in this window and your preferred
 order will be saved automatically.

Note that View >> Hide Toolbar and View >> Customize Toolbar also
 work for the Session Info window, and can be used to change your
 display settings for the top of that window.

h2(#commandline). Command Line

The command line is a special interface to the active terminal
 window.  See "the terminals page":terminals.html#commandline for more information.

h2(#ipaddr). Network Addresses of This Mac

Using Window >> Network Addresses of This Mac or the equivalent command
 from MacTerm's Dock menu, you can display a floating window
 with a list of IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses for your computer's
 network interfaces.

Each item in the list can be dragged with the mouse and dropped
 (into a terminal window, for instance), to type in that address.

See also the Macros pane in the main settings window, which can be
 used to define macros with text substitution that employ the
 @\i@ or @\I@ address expansion sequences.

h2(#keypads). Keypads

MacTerm provides a number of powerful keypad windows.  Clicking
 a keypad button is equivalent to typing the key or key sequence
 it represents.  However, keypad buttons __always__ send the right
 character code or character sequence, even in cases where the
 keyboard might not work (because of a terminal mode or a
 conflicting macOS keyboard mapping, etc.).

h3(#controlkeys). Control Keys

This is a floating window providing access to 32 control key
 combinations, "invisible" characters of the ASCII character set.
 These keys are frequently useful in terminals and therefore are
 likely to trigger special responses when used.

The tooltips for these keys are especially useful because they
 contain additional information about each key: its short name,
 its numeric code (in hexadecimal), and a brief description of
 the key's usual purpose.

h3(#functionkeys). Function Keys

This is a floating window providing access to the function keys
 of a VT220 terminal or an XTerm variant.  MacTerm does not
 currently allow you to synchronize the function key layout with a
 session, so be sure to pick the layout that works best for you.

The pop-up menu in the title bar of the "Function Keys" window
 can be used to modify the layout and availability of function keys.
 The possibilities are:

* **VT220 / "multi-gnome-terminal"**: This is the default, and is actually the set used by "multi-gnome-terminal" (a superset of what VT220 requires).  It sets function keys F1-F4 to match the VT100's PF1-PF4 keys (since the VT220 doesn't use them), gives F5 the code that XTerm would use, and sets function keys F6-F20 to VT220 specifications.  Keys F21-F48 are unavailable.
* **XTerm (X11)**: This gives you access to 48 function keys, all of which have specific behavior according to the version of XTerm that comes with an ordinary X11R6 release.  Keys F1-F12 match the VT220.
* **XTerm (XFree86) / "gnome-terminal" / GNU "screen"**: This gives you access to 48 function keys, all of which have specific behavior according to the version of XTerm that comes with XFree86.  The keys unique to XFree86 are the ranges F1-F4, F13-F16, F25-F28 and F37-F40; all others match "XTerm (X11)".  This is a superset of the keys used by "gnome-terminal" and GNU "screen".
* **rxvt**: This gives you access to 48 function keys, all of which have specific behavior according to the "rxvt" terminal emulator.  This set has a few keys in common with XTerm, but is mostly unique.

Unless you have used the macro editor to map your keyboard's
 function keys to macros, they will map to VT220 function keys by
 default.  Each key is __offset by 5__, so your keyboard F1 maps
 to the VT220 F6, and your keyboard F15 maps to the VT220 F20.

h3(#vt220keypad). VT220 Keypad

This is a floating window providing access to the special keypad
 functions of a real VT220 terminal.  MacTerm will not prevent
 their use when you have selected a terminal emulator other than
 VT220, however your session may respond oddly to some of the
 keys.

The tooltips for certain VT220 keys will give you descriptions.
