    Return a pair of integers as a tuple, where the first
    is a zero-based CHARACTER offset into the given string,
    and the second is a CHARACTER count from that offset.
    This range identifies a word that is found by scanning
    forwards and backwards from the given starting CHARACTER
    in the given string of BYTES.  Don't use byte offsets!

    This is designed to be compatible with the callback
    format required by quills.Terminal.on_seekword_call().
