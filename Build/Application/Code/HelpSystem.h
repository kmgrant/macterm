/*!	\file HelpSystem.h
	\brief A simple mechanism for managing access to the
	application’s user documentation and context-sensitive
	help.
	
	To reduce dependencies on the actual string value of a
	contextual help search, this module usually operates in
	terms of symbolic constants; however, in rare cases where
	the string value is needed (to set the name of a menu item,
	usually), an API is provided.
