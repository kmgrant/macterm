# NOTES:
# - these key-value pairs are used to generate the
#   ExactMatch.plist file; per that file's requirements,
#   the key must collapse a phrase into all-lowercase
#   without spaces, and the value must exactly match an
#   HTML <a name="..."></a> in one or more files
# - since this is language-based, any localized strings
#   will need localized versions of this key-value file
# - many of these phrases' original texts are also used
#   as context-sensitive Help menu commands, whose
#   original strings are in UIStrings.cp
