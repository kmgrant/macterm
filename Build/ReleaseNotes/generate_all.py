    The 'kwargs' dictionary may provide hints as to the type of HTML
    document being produced:
    
    - 'recent_versions'
      An array of versions that should be included in the document.
      For a "daily build" log this will basically be *every* dated
      version; for any other version-specific document this will be
      a list of all versions between the user's current version and
      the latest available version.  N/A for other document types.
    
    Template lines may contain several special markers that affect
    the behavior of the generator:
    
    - Python-style %-references that refer to settings in 'subst_kv'.
      You may populate this dictionary in advance but other values
      may be added (see below) based on the section(s) and/or loop(s)
      that directly or indirectly contain a template line.
    
    - '<!-- BEGIN:MY-SECTION -->' and '<!-- END:MY-SECTION -->'
      bracket lines in the section 'MY-SECTION'.  A set of variables
      is defined according to the section name (in this case,
      'MY-SECTION').  In addition, NESTED sections make available ALL
      variables from parent contexts.
    
    - '<!-- BEGIN-LOOP:MY-LOOP -->' and '<!-- END-LOOP:MY-LOOP-->'
      bracket lines in the looping section 'MY-LOOP'.  A set of
      variables is defined PER ITERATION according to the loop name
      (in this case, 'MY-LOOP').  In addition, NESTED sections make
      available ALL variables from parent contexts; if a parent is a
      loop then implicitly the inherited value is the current
      iteration of the loop.
    
    - The pattern '<http://...>' is replaced by HTML that links to
      the specified URL.
    
    - The pattern '<https://...>' is replaced by HTML that links to
      the specified secure URL.
    
    The section and/or loop hierarchy is as follows (lower levels
    implicitly have access to variables defined by parents):
    
      NO-UPDATES
       '--- (none)
      CHANGE-LOG
       |--- YEAR-LINK [LOOP]
       '--- VERSION [LOOP]
             '--- RELEASE-NOTES [LOOP]
    
      A template file may define any sections and loops it wants but
      only the patterns above guarantee that you will be able to
      inherit the corresponding parents' variables.
      
      A CHANGE-LOG section contains a description of a range of
      changes to MacTerm.  It can be (but is not required to be)
      coupled with a parallel NO-UPDATES section that the user would
      see if their current version was already up-to-date.
      
      A VERSION loop contains lines that are repeated for all the
      versions that apply to the current document.  It is very common
      for a sub-loop RELEASE-NOTES to be defined that contains all
      the release notes applicable to a version.
    
    The following special keys take precedence over 'subst_kv' and
    they are only guaranteed to be defined in the given [SECTION]
    (some may also appear outside any section):
    
    - 'latest_year' [YEAR-LINK]
      The 4-digit year of the most recent log; this helps the link
      generator to determine when to link to the daily build log
      versus a particular log from an older year.
    
    - 'log_year' [global]
      If the template's purpose is to represent a single year of
      MacTerm changes then this is that 4-digit year string.
    
    - 'release_note' [RELEASE-NOTES]
      The text for a release note in an iteration.
    
    - 'user_version' [global]
      In templates that produce update pages for particular versions,
      this is the user's old version.  For example, '4.0.0' would be
      the 'user_version' for the page that users of 4.0.0 see when they
      run "Check for Updates".
    
    - 'version' [global, VERSION]
      A version in a VERSION loop or a version for a whole file.
    
    - 'year' [YEAR, YEAR-LINK]
      A 4-digit year in a YEAR loop.
    
    - 'year_order' [CHANGE-LOG, YEAR, YEAR-LINK]
      An ordered list of 4-digit year values, used for such things
      as lists of links are ordered by year.  Generally this should
      contain the entire range of years from latest to oldest.
    
    - 'year_log_list_item_html' [YEAR]
      An HTML fragment that links to the change log for the current
      year in an iteration, or equivalently-spaced plain text when
      the year matches that of the currently-generated web page.
