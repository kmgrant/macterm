ABOUT THE MACTERM PROJECT
  Welcome to this source release of MacTerm for modern macOS!
  
  Formerly known as MacTelnet (and before that, NCSA Telnet),
  this is now primarily a modern macOS terminal program.
  
  MacTerm's goal is to be an excellent terminal emulation
  program for macOS, while also being very easy to use.  It
  streamlines terminal work on both local and remote machines
  by giving the user just the right set of powerful features, a
  smart set of preferences and convenient window management.
  
  MacTerm's core features are implemented in Objective-C++ and
  Python, through bindings created by SWIG.  Python can also be
  used to create extensions (see "macterm.net" for details).
  
  MacTerm's development environment makes use of Python, Perl,
  shell scripts and GNU makefiles for various infrastructure and
  documentation utilities.  In addition, HTML help pages are
  generated by the PyTextile tool (included) so that original
  help content can be maintained in a highly-readable format.
  
  After years of using Subversion, in mid-2015 MacTerm has moved
  to "git" and the repository is currently on GitHub (see below).
