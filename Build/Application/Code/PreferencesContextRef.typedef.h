/*!
A context represents a source of preferences.  It is very
flexible; a context could represent just temporary data in
memory, or full-blown CFPreferences defaults in the application
domain, or some other domain, or even the “factory defaults”
in "DefaultPreferences.plist".  It is possible to manipulate
and transfer data between contexts regardless of what they
represent underneath.  A context can be independent, or it can
be directly associated with a known and named collection that
is saved to disk.
