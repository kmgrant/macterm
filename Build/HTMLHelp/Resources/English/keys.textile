h1(pagetitle). Emulating Keys From Other Keyboards

notextile. <div class="content">

p(#abstract). Although you can use "palettes":windows.html#keypads
 to help interact with certain programs in a terminal, you may need
 keys that aren't in any palette.  Fortunately, MacTerm's
 "Macro settings":preferences.html#macros allow you to map anything
 you want to your Mac's keyboard, including key sequences that just
 "do the right thing" on another computer.

h2. X11 Keyboard Reference

Below are example macros that emulate function keys on Unix-like
 operating systems.

Before using any of the following in a macro, be sure that the macro
 is set to "Enter Text with Substitutions".

Each sequence should be entered exactly into a macro, without any
 spaces or other characters.

h2. VT220 Keyboard Reference

The "palette of VT220 keys":windows.html#keypads can be used to send
 VT220 keys, but you may also want to use them in macros.

VT220 function keys match the table above, with the exceptions of
 PF1-PF4, which are defined as follows:

table(deftable).
(def). |_<(key). Key|_<(desc). Sequence|
(def). |<(key). @PF1@|<(desc). @\eOP@|
(def). |<(key). @PF2@|<(desc). @\eOQ@|

(def). |<(key). Insert|<(desc). @\e[2~@|
(def). |<(key). Delete|<(desc). @\e[3~@|
(def). |<(key). Select|<(desc). @\e[4~@|
(def). |<(key). Page Up|<(desc). @\e[5~@|
