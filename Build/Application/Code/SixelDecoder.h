A “color chooser block” is invoked each time the parser
encounters a request for a color.  See also the
SixelDecoder_ColorCreator block type for creating and
selecting arbitrary colors.
*/
typedef void (^SixelDecoder_ColorChooser)(UInt16 inZeroBasedIndex);

/*!
A “color creator block” is invoked once for each new color
definition encountered by the decoder.  Typically this is
an opportunity to also create the color in a graphics space,
e.g. defining an equivalent NSColor object.

The first integer before the color type is the index of the
new color being defined or replaced.  Technically the Sixel
specification for the VT300 series says that the index can be
no greater than 255 but there is no enforced limit in this
implementation.

The exact meaning of the parameters depends on the color type
and their ranges match the Sixel specification.  (Currently
this means a “hue” is 0 to 360 degrees and any other type of
value is between 0 and 100 percent intensity.)
*/
typedef void (^SixelDecoder_ColorCreator)(UInt16, SixelDecoder_ColorType, UInt16, UInt16, UInt16);

/*!
A “sixel handler block” is invoked once for each raw sixel
data character or repetition sequence, along with the count
of the repetition (at least 1).  Use getSixelBits() on the
raw value to find the top-to-bottom sixel on/off sequences,
and use the most recent call of a SixelDecoder_ColorHandler
to determine the color to use.  Since this can be called
continuously during parsing, the decoder object is not
guaranteed to be in a final state (for instance, the
"graphicsCursorMaxX" would only refer to the greatest
value so far).  On the other hand, since the protocol does
naturally define certain values at the beginning, you can
rely on most of them (such as "suggestedImageWidth").
