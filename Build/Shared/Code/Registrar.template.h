/*!
Automatically adds the specified reference to a set when
constructed, and removes it when destructed.

Typically, you make one of these the first data member of
an internal class whose pointer is tracked by an opaque
reference type.  This way, when the class is constructed
its reference is added to the list and when it is destroyed
it is removed.

Another application is to declare one of these within the
code of a constructor or destructor, attached to a different
list of references that track “unstable” pointers.  This is
useful for debugging if code is called using a pointer to a
data structure that is technically partially defined due to
construction or destruction.
