The error parameter is a standard autoreleasing
NSError object.  You can pass nullptr if you do not
want the error information but you should probably
display it to the user using the "presentError:"
method of NSResponder.

A handle to the running application is returned,

The CFBundle API views the main bundle as the place
where the parent executable lives, and this is not
correct in cases like a scripting environment where
the interpreter is the parent.  This API ensures the
right bundle for resources can still be used.
