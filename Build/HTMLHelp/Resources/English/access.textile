h2(#servers). Remote Sessions: Connecting to Servers

Select File >> Custom New Session... to begin.

bq. Only your first sessions should require this
 customization step.  In the future, it will be faster
 to rely on a Favorite or a saved session file to hold
 your settings.  A Favorite can be opened directly
 from the File menu; for others, use File >> Open.

A Custom New Session opens a terminal window and a sheet to allow
 configuration.

This sheet is identical to the equivalent panel of the MacTerm settings
 window, so just review the "settings documentation":preferences.html#sessionresource for more.

Unlike global settings, changes to the sheet are temporary and
 can be either discarded or committed using the sheet's buttons.

h2(#unix). Local Sessions: Running Unix Commands

As with remote applications, File >> Open... can be used to run a
 command that you previously saved.

You have a few options for new commands:

* File >> Shell opens your default Unix shell, where you can type commands interactively.

* File >> Default (or the name of any other collection of Session settings) in the "New Session:" section of the File menu, will open that session.

* File >> Custom New Session... can also be used; simply ignore the "Remote Shell..." button, and enter command line text.

* Hold down Option to see File >> Log-In Shell.  This invokes a shell in log-in mode (with shell-dependent settings) that will not inherit any environment variable settings from MacTerm.

bq. Most session creation commands are also available
 from the MacTerm icon's Dock menu.

h2(#workspaces). Workspaces: Starting Several Sessions

Using MacTerm settings, you can define Workspaces, which specify a
 set of sessions that should all start at the same time, in a
 certain window arrangement.

Once a workspace is defined, go to the "New From Workspace:"
 section of the File menu, and use File >> Default (or the name of
 any other collection of Workspace settings), to create
 the sessions of a workspace.

h2(#dupwin). Replicating Windows

You can use File >> Duplicate Session to spawn a new window that
 is running the same command as the previous window.

Currently, only the command is duplicated; other window settings
 may come from your defaults.  Once a window is duplicated, any
 updates to the window will not affect its duplicate.

h2(#restart). Restarting Commands

If the "No window close on process exit" setting is set, a
 session window will remain open when it quits by itself (that is,
 if it was not explicitly terminated using File >> Close or your
 mouse).  When the window is in this dead state, the special
 File >> Restart Session command becomes available.

When you restart a session, the original local or remote command
 line is run again in the same window, preserving your entire
 scrollback buffer and other window settings.  Most programs do
 not aggressively save their state, so a restart is unlikely to
 let you simply resume where the program left off when it last
 exited.
