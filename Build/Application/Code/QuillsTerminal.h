Return a pair of integers as a tuple, where the first is a\n\

byte offsets!  In particular, UTF-8 supports single characters\n\
that are described by multiple bytes, and you should be skipping\n\
all of the bytes to reach the next character in the string.  (It\n\
can be quite helpful to use the Python 'unicode' built-in object\n\
for this; see the default, registered in 'RunApplication.py'.)\n\
