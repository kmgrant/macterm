/*!	\file PopoverManager.objc++.h
	\brief Provides common support code that is generally
	needed by any window that acts like a popover.
	
	This module takes care of details like responding to
	parent window changes (e.g. relocating the popover
	as the parent resizes) and automatically hiding the
	popover in certain situations.  It also handles any
	animation.
	
	You typically start by creating a Popover_Window
	with the required views, and then using this routine
	to specify that window and its parent.  Once you use
	this interface to show the popover, its behavior is
	largely managed for you.  You may also force the
	popover to be hidden through this interface, so that
	you can use consistent animation in that case.
	
	Currently this module supports Cocoa-based popovers
	on top of Carbon-based windows only.  In the future,
	as needed, it will make sense to support Cocoa parent
	windows too.
