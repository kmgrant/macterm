/*!	\file RetainRelease.template.h
	\brief Convenient template class to call retain and release
	routines that follow a certain convention, via RAII.
	
	Use this to ensure a reference is automatically retained at
	object construction or duplication time, and automatically
	released when the object is destroyed.  Wrappers mean that
	custom constructors and destructors are not required for a
	class if it simply wants to hold onto a reference-counted
	object reference indefinitely.
	
	This class also allows references to be null.  You can make
	an existing object of this type equal to nullptr by calling
	the clear() method, or by assigning to it a temporary
	instance with no arguments, such as
	"myRetainReleaseInstance = RetainRelease();"; or, use
	"myRetainReleaseInstance = RetainRelease(nullptr);" if
	you want to be more explicit (these are equivalent).
	
	Finally, RetainRelease can be release-only: it can be
	initialized by a reference that is already retained (such as
	something returned by a ..._New() function), in which case
	no retain is called but the release is still called.
	
	WARNING:	Objective-C++ breaks RAII when it comes to
				exceptions; destructors are NOT called if the
				scope exits because an NSException* was thrown!
				You may still declare wrapper objects such as
				this within code that calls Objective-C, but
				you should have a "@try" block with a "@finally"
				block that uses clear() on RetainRelease objects.
				This has the advantage of being a conditional
				release; if the object contains a non-nil pointer
				then it will be released, otherwise nothing is
				done.  Note again that this is only necessary in
				code that might call Objective-C and trigger an
				exception; it is not necessary for pure C++.

/*!
Use instead of a regular reference in order to have the
reference automatically retained with the specified retainer
function when constructed, assigned or copied, and released
with the specified release function when it goes out of scope
or is assigned, etc.

Unlike CFRetainRelease, this object can only store one type of
value (enforced by template) but it has the flexibility to use
any retain/release mechanism and it has more compile-time
checks because of the single known reference type.

It is possible to have a nullptr value, and no retain or
release occurs in this case.  It is therefore safe to initialize
to nullptr and later assign a value that should be retained and
released, etc.

IMPORTANT:	The reference manager type must be struct with two
			static methods, both of which return void and take a
			single argument of a reference type.  That reference
			type should be available as a public typedef in the
			struct, named "reference_type".
