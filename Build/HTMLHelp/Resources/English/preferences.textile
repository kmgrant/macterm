h2(#collections). About Grouped Settings

When you select the Macros, Workspaces, Sessions, Terminals,
 Formats or Translations categories, a special list of collections
 appears.  This means you may create *groups of settings*.  The
 list is unique for every category.

The order of collections can be changed by dragging items in the
 list.

h3. "Default" Item

Every list starts with a Default item.  If you do not want to
 create other groups, you can just edit the Default.  Keep in
 mind though that the Default is implicitly inherited by all
 other collections for settings that are not made explicitly in
 those collections.  The Default items also have special meanings
 for each category:

* The Default under "Macros" determines the set of macros that is first enabled in the Macros menu for any session that does not specify its own macro set (such as log-in shells).  Also, when you select a different macro set in the Macros menu, any menu item that is not implemented by the new macro set will continue to display the corresponding item from the Default macro set.  You can use this to define a mixture of actions that are always available and a subset of actions that can change.

* The Default under "Workspaces" determines what sessions spawn when MacTerm starts.  (You can use this to spawn several windows automatically if you wish.  You can also choose to disable all window slots in the Default Workspace so that no windows are spawned at startup time.)

* The Default under "Sessions" is always listed first in the File menu and there is an option to map it to a key equivalent.

* The Default under "Terminals" is used in any session that does not specify its own terminal (such as a log-in shell).

* The Default under "Formats" is used in any session that does not specify its own format (such as a log-in shell).

* The Default under "Translations" is used in any session that does not specify its own translation (such as a log-in shell).

h3. "+" Menu Button

This menu provides commands for creating new collections:

h4. New Collection

Adds a new item to the list.

h4. Import from File...

Use this to create a new collection based on settings that were
 exported to a file previously, or that originated in another
 supported application.  You may select any number of files to
 import at once.  Remember that you can drag to reorder
 collections in your list, even though they initially appear at
 the bottom.

The type of collection created, such as a Session or Format, is
 determined by examining the kinds of settings in the imported
 file.  Therefore, no matter which settings panel is showing,
 the imported file will appear in the appropriate category.

Currently you may import any previously-exported ".plist" file
 created by MacTerm, or a ".itermcolors" file.  You can find
 existing files in these formats from the MacTerm.net web site
 and other sites such as "iterm2colorschemes.com".

The new collection will try to use any name that was given in
 the file.  For MacTerm imports, if the name is already in use
 then the collection will appear under a different name.  For
 imports of ".itermcolors", the new collection name is based on
 the file name and any existing collection with the same name
 will automatically be updated.

The ".itermcolors" file is mostly compatible with MacTerm but
 there are some exceptions.  Text selection colors from the file
 are translated into blink colors in MacTerm, and the background
 color in the file is reused for the bold background and matte
 background color in MacTerm.  The cursor text color is ignored.

h3. "-" Button

First select an item in the list and then use this button to
 remove the item.  (A confirmation message is presented.)

h3. Gear Menu Button

This is a contextual menu that provides additional commands for
 acting on whatever item in the list is selected:

h4. Copy Collection Settings to Default...

Overwrites the Default settings in the current category to use
 the settings of the collection that you select.  (A confirmation
 message is presented.)

Note that Default settings have multiple uses; see the help
 content in the sections above for details.  For instance, if
 other collections inherit several settings from Default, they
 may all appear to change once you overwrite the Default.

Backing up your Default settings beforehand is recommended.  You
 can do this in a couple of ways: you can use "Duplicate Collection"
 (see below) to make a copy under a new name, or you can use the
 "Export to File..." command.

One typical application of this command is to copy another color
 scheme in place of your Default.  Although, this can be used in
 any settings category that has collections.

h4. Duplicate Collection

Makes a copy of the selected collection of settings and
 also creates a field for renaming the new collection.  Note
 that only defined settings are copied; anything that was being
 inherited by the original (from Default) continues to be
 inherited in the copy.

h4. Rename Collection

Creates an editable field around the name of the item so that
 you can call it something else.  Note that "Default" cannot be
 renamed.  *The Return key is a short-cut for this action.*

h4. Export to File...

Use this to create a property list file containing settings from
 the selected collection.

You have a choice in how to handle inherited settings, via the
 "Copy from Default as needed (inheritance not preserved on import)"
 checkbox in the save panel.  If inherited settings are copied
 from their current Default values, the file acts as a snapshot
 of any defaults that you are using; therefore, a future import of
 the file will create a collection based on the old snapshot and
 not reflect any changes that may have been made to Default values
 in the meantime.  Whereas, a file that does not copy inherited
 values could be smaller and a future import will fill in any gaps
 using the values in Default at the time of the import (even if
 they have changed).

Exported settings are a good way to share among users of MacTerm.
 For instance, if you are the administrator of a school you might
 want to export some settings and make them available to students
 so that everyone's computer can be configured fairly easily.  If
 you intend to share exported files, it is a good idea to enable
 the checkbox in the save panel (to have settings copied from
 Default as needed, creating a complete snapshot of what you
 started from).

h2(#inheritance). About Inherited Settings

In collection-based settings panels, a "Use Default" column of
 checkboxes is available to control which settings are inherited
 from the corresponding Default.

This is a great way to avoid unnecessary duplicates; for example,
 you might want to set a Font only once and have most of your
 other Format settings use the same value.

Note that *when a Default setting is changed, any collections*
 *that are set to inherit that setting will implicitly change* so
 be sure to set "local" versions of any settings that should
 remain unique.

To make a unique local value, simply edit the corresponding
 setting.  The initial edit must set a value that is different
 from the Default.  After the first change, you can change the
 value back if you want it to copy without inheriting.

To remove a local variation and restore inheritance from Default,
 click the corresponding checkbox in the "Use Default" column for
 the setting.  (Sometimes, if multiple settings are arranged
 side-by-side horizontally, there will be multiple checkboxes on
 that line to select which one to make Default.)

h2(#search). About Settings Search

The settings window has a search field that can help you find
 certain settings.

To search, enter key words in the field and press Return.  If
 any matches are found, a menu pops up displaying the icon of the
 main category, followed by either the name of the main category
 or the name of one of the tabs from that panel.

You don't have to be exact; MacTerm will search for any key word
 that starts with what you type (allowing, for instance, the
 word "graph" to mean "graphics" or the word "com" to mean
 "command").  The search recognizes some synonyms, too.  Of
 course, the more precise you are, the better chance you have of
 seeing focused search results.

While the menu is open the usual navigation keys will work, such
 as: arrows to move up or down, letters to jump to items, Return
 to select something and Esc to dismiss the menu.

If you press Esc while typing in the search field, it will be
 cleared.

h2(#general). General

h3(#generaloptions). Options

h4. Terminal Windows

h5(#noautoclose). No window close on process exit

Prevents a window from closing when the process running inside it
 has quit.  This only applies to processes that quit on their own;
 if you choose to close a window yourself, it will not stay open.

When a window has terminated and remains open, the special menu
 command File >> Restart Session becomes available.

h5(#noautonew). No automatic new windows

Prevents a new session from being created at startup, or when the
 application is activated and no windows are open.

Note that the type of session created will implicitly match the
 "Command-N Key Equivalent" setting.

h5(#fadebkgnd). Fade in background

Causes terminal windows to become translucent when MacTerm is not
 the active application.

Low-level settings can be used to further customize this mode.

h4. Text

h5(#invert). Invert selected text

Uses high contrast colors for text selections instead of trying
 to create a blend with the current window color scheme.

h5(#autocopy). Automatically Copy selected text

Whenever new text is highlighted, it is copied to the Clipboard.
 This is how Unix-like systems behave, and may be how you are
 accustomed to working with terminal-based applications.

h5(#dropmove). Move cursor to text drop location

Displays a ghost terminal cursor during drags, and sends a series
 of arrow key sequences to move the cursor when the drag ends.

When terminal applications properly respond to the sequences, the
 result is effectively to give them Mac-like drag-and-drop!

However, not all terminal applications properly respond to arrow
 key sequences.  The typical error is to display various "garbage"
 characters instead of moving the cursor.

h5(#nodim). Don't dim background terminal text

To help emphasize the active terminal, MacTerm alters the color
 hues of background windows.  Use this option to quell recoloring.

h5(#nopastewarn). Don't warn about multi-line Paste

Immediately dumps text into a terminal on Paste, instead of
 displaying a "Join" option when the text spans multiple lines.

Note that even if the warning appears, a "Paste Normally" option
 is always provided.

A number of programs, like Unix shells, will perform actions when
 they see new-line characters.  If you use these kinds of programs
 frequently in a session, then disabling the Paste warning is not
 recommended.

h4. Keyboard

h5(#mapbackquote). Treat backquote key like Escape

On many keyboards, the backquote key is in a location similar to
 or identical to the location of the Esc key on other keyboards.
 Some users may wish to treat backquote keypresses as if they were
 escape keypresses for this reason, especially if using something
 that relies heavily on Esc such as the "vi" text editor.

Note, however, that Unix shells and other applications may
 require use of a backquote.

h5(#focusfollowsmouse). Focus follows mouse

Allows you to type into any terminal without bringing its window
 to the front; you simply point at the terminal with the mouse
 before typing.  This is the way many window managers behave on
 Unix-like systems.

h3(#generalspecial). Special

h4. Terminal Cursor

h5(#cursorshape). Shape

MacTerm allows one of 5 different shapes for the terminal
 cursor; a solid square is typical but you may wish to have the
 standard Mac vertical bar, a horizontal underline, or thicker
 versions of either (more noticeable on LCD displays).

h5(#cursorflash). Flash

The cursor blinks on and off periodically when Flash is set,
 which may make it easier to see.  But, see also the Find Cursor
 command in the Edit menu, which locates the cursor on demand.

h4(#stackorigin). Window Stacking Origin

You can specify the location (on any display) where a new window
 is placed.  Subsequent windows automatically stack diagonally.

Note that windows restored as part of a Workspace (File menu)
 will give precedence to any boundaries that might be saved with
 the Workspace.

h4(#resizeeffect). Window Resize Effect

The Window Resize Effect determines how terminal windows are
 altered when resized explicitly with the mouse, or implicitly
 when entering Full Screen mode.

When window resizes affect terminal screen size, MacTerm
 dynamically calculates the maximum number of rows and columns
 that can fit in the current window size (at current font size).

When window resizes affect text size, MacTerm dynamically
 calculates the maximum font size that can be used (in the current
 terminal font) to fit the current number of rows and columns in
 the current window size.

You can hold down the Control key prior to starting a window resize
 to temporarily switch this setting for that resize only.  The
 Option key can be held down to have the same effect when you use
 the "Enter Full Screen" command.

h4(#spacesfortab). Tab Conversion

When copying text using Copy with Tab Substitution, this number
 determines how many consecutive spaces are replaced with a single
 tab character before putting the text on the clipboard.

h4(#commandN). Command-N Key Equivalent

MacTerm has several ways to create sessions, and you may wish
 to use one of them more than others.  You can map command-N as a
 short-cut to whichever one you use most.

Note that this previously would also determine the window that
 opens automatically at startup.  But, the startup window(s) now
 come from the Default Workspace collection.

h3(#generalfullscreen). Full Screen

h4. Access Control

h5. Show scroll bar

If your goal is to run an application in the terminal window for
 visitors of a kiosk, it may be appropriate to hide the scroll bar
 so that none of the "junk" normally cached in the scrollback is
 accessible.

h5. Show menu bar on demand

The menu bar is hidden in Full Screen mode but it can normally
 be displayed simply by moving the mouse to the top of the screen
 and pausing a moment.

If you want the menu bar to be completely unusable, disable this
 option.

h5. Show window frame

If unset, the content region of a terminal window fills its whole
 display, leaving no room for the window title or toolbar (though
 the colored matte space is still present, and there is space for
 a scroll bar).

h5. Allow "Force Quit" command

To make kiosks harder to mess with, you can prevent the user from
 accessing the system Force Quit function (along with some other
 key Apple menu items chosen by the system).

Note, this offers "pretty good" security but it does not guard
 against all possible ways that MacTerm could be interrupted.
 For example, a background application could pop up, MacTerm
 could crash, or the user may be able to command-Tab to some other
 program.

h3(#generalnotification). Notifications

h4. Terminal Bell

h5. Sound

When a terminal audio event occurs, you can have MacTerm ignore
 it, or play the standard system beep, or any other library sound.

The set of sounds in the menu is defined the first time the
 settings window opens, based on the contents of any Sounds
 folders found in /System/Library, /Library, or the Library folder
 of your Home folder.

Note that sound can also be controlled in individual terminals by
 using the "Bell" command in the Terminal menu (or the
 corresponding toolbar item).

h5(#visualbell). Always use visual bell

If a terminal window is not active, any bell events from the
 window (regardless of sound settings) will include a visual flash
 to show you which window the bell came from.

However, you can choose to enable visuals all the time, in which
 case even active terminals will flash when bells occur.

h5(#notifybeeps). Background notification on bell

If MacTerm is not the active application, you can ask that you
 receive special notification from the OS when one of your
 terminals generates a bell.

h4(#notifymethod). When In Background

For "Background notification on bell", as well as any other alert
 that may show up when you are in another application (such as an
 error message), you can specify how "annoying" MacTerm may be.
 The options range from no interruptions at all, to an immediate
 alert in your other application telling you that MacTerm needs
 your attention.

h2(#macros). Macros

bq. You can create more than one set of settings in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a sidebar
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the sidebar, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main settings
 window.

bq. Each set in this category has an additional list
 of items.  First choose a set from the sidebar, then
 choose an item from the numbered list, before editing.
 You can also edit the names of the numbered items, as
 you would for any item in the Finder.

Macro sets are completely arbitrary actions that you can bind
 to almost any key combinations you wish!

The Macros menu displays macros that are currently in effect,
 along with their key equivalents.  You can only choose one
 set at a time but the menu will also show actions inherited
 from Default (actions in slots not reimplemented by the set
 that you have chosen).  See the "Default Item" section above.

It is also possible to display macros in the toolbar.  Each
 macro toolbar item is associated with an entry in the current
 macro set, and it dynamically changes.  For example, if the
 item "Macro 1" is put in the toolbar, the item will always
 activate the first macro in the current macro set and the item
 name will change with the macro.  (If a macro has no name, a
 generic icon and macro number is shown instead.)

The active set of macros is determined in three ways:

- You can use the Macros menu.  If the "None" set is chosen,
  all macros are disabled.  Once you override macros for a
  terminal, this choice is preserved whenever you switch back
  to the same window.

- If you select a "Default Macro Set" when configuring a new
  Session, that set will be used when the window opens (and
  whenever switching back to that window, unless you change it
  manually above).

- The "Default" set of macros is consulted in any other case,
  including shell windows.

A macro can be used by typing its key equivalent (displayed in
 the Macros menu), by selecting its name from the Macros menu
 or by clicking a toolbar item corresponding to the macro.

h3. Macro List

This displays the number of macros in the set (currently fixed
 at 12), and their names.

The names can be edited by clicking and hovering on them, or
 selecting an item and pressing Return.  Names are used in the
 Macros menu and in macro toolbar items.

h3. Selected Macro

To edit a macro, select it from the list and then modify its
 fields in this section.  Changes take effect immediately (so,
 you could test in a terminal window at the same time, provided
 you made this the current macro set via the Map menu).

h4. Invoke With

The key or combination of keys that will trigger the macro
 action.

If "Ordinary Key" is selected, you should type one character
 into the field next to the pop-up menu to indicate which key.
 For example, "K" indicates that typing the K key will activate
 the macro.

Alternately, you can choose from a number of "special" keys
 in the menu.

No matter which keys you choose, you have to be mindful of
 what may already be in use by MacTerm, your computer's
 defaults, or the application you're going to run in the
 terminal.  In general, it's not a good idea to choose very
 simple key combinations.

**Important:** If you use the Macros menu to select the set you
 are editing, it is easy to see how your key equivalent will be
 interpreted by macOS.  Certain combinations are "special"
 and will not be available to you.

h4. Modifiers

Any combination of zero to four standard modifier keys that
 must be held down _in addition_ to the "Invoke With" key,
 before the macro will be activated.

Modifiers are highly recommended!  Most keys are needed for
 other things by default, and shouldn't invoke macros by
 themselves.

Note that if you use "Ordinary Key" and a character that
 normally requires the ⇧ key (such as a capital letter),
 the ⇧ modifier is implied even if it does not appear
 selected in this section.

h4. Action

The type of behavior the macro will trigger, and the way the
 Contents will be interpreted:

h5. Open URL

The Contents are interpreted as a URL and opened locally with
 whatever helper application is appropriate (such as your
 preferred web browser).

h5. Select Window by Title

The Contents are interpreted as a word or phrase to scan for in
 the titles of open terminal windows.  The next window in the
 rotation with a matching title is automatically brought to the
 front.

This mode is very good for moving between similar windows.  If
 you have a pattern in the title that is only present in some of
 your terminals, you can use your macro repeatedly to cycle
 through all the matching windows.

h5. New Window with Command

The Contents are interpreted as a command line, split into
 words (on whitespace) and run in a new terminal window.
 When the command finishes, the terminal window is closed.

Note that you can overcome limitations of this command line
 by running your command in a shell, or providing the path to
 a script (written in any language) that does more elaborate
 things.

h5. Enter Text Verbatim

The Contents will be typed into the active terminal view as if
 the keyboard was used, and *no* special sequences will be
 substituted.

h5. Find in Local Terminal Verbatim

The Contents will be used to search for matching text in the
 active terminal view as if the Find command had been used, and
 *no* special sequences will be substituted.

h5. Enter Text with Substitutions and Find in Local Terminal with Substitutions

The Contents will be scrubbed for any special sequences (as
 defined below) and replaced with the indicated values; only
 the modified version is used to Enter or Find text respectively.

These modes are very useful if your macro needs to operate on
 the current text selection, or if it contains escape sequences
 or other "invisible" characters (common when
 "emulating key codes":keys.html from other operating systems,
 for example).

bq. *Tip:* If you create a macro with content of "\j" (joined text
 selection) and action "Find in Local Terminal with Substitutions",
 you can use it to perform a search for any phrase you select
 with the mouse -- even if it wraps from one line to another.
 Similarly, you can use "\:" to do this with text from the
 Clipboard.

Many substitution sequences correspond directly to the codes
 used by control keys.  For this reason, MacTerm offers an
 "Insert Control Key Character..." button that helps you type
 the correct sequences with a single click.  For example, the
 control-D character is equivalent to "\004", and when the
 palette is opened you can simply click the "^D" button to
 insert a "\004" sequence.

Note that macros with substitutions can fail if your macro
 has errors.  You can use the Console application to see errors
 that MacTerm generated for your macro.

The possible substitutions are:

table(deftable).
(def). |_<(key). Code|_<(desc). Meaning|
(def). |<(key). @\\@|(desc)<. backslash (@\@)|
(def). |<(key). @\0nn@|(desc)<. arbitrary ASCII in octal[1]; e.g. @\004@ is @^D@|
(def). |<(key). @\1nn@|(desc)<. arbitrary ASCII in octal[1]; e.g. @\177@ is delete|
(def). |<(key). @\b@|(desc)<. backspace (equivalent to @\010@)|
(def). |<(key). @\e@|(desc)<. escape (@^[@; equivalent to @\033@)|
(def). |<(key). @\i@|(desc)<. substitute network address[2] of computer|
(def). |<(key). @\I@|(desc)<. substitute space-separated list of all network addresses[2] of computer|
(def). |<(key). @\j@|(desc)<. substitute terminal's current text selection[3], replacing all new-lines with spaces (to join into one line)|
(def). |<(key). @\n@|(desc)<. new-line sequence for current session: either CR, CR-LF, CR-NULL or LF|
(def). |<(key). @\q@|(desc)<. substitute terminal's current text selection[3], stripping all new-lines and quoting (inserting backslashes before every space or tab)|
(def). |<(key). @\r@|(desc)<. carriage return (@^M@; equivalent to @\015@)|
(def). |<(key). @\s@|(desc)<. substitute terminal's current text selection[3], verbatim (even keeping new-lines)|
(def). |<(key). @\t@|(desc)<. horizontal tab|
(def). |<(key). @\.@|(desc)<. substitute text from Clipboard[4] at this point, as if Paste had been used; each line (except last) is followed by new-line sequence for current session: either CR, CR-LF, CF-NULL or LF|
(def). |<(key). @\:@|(desc)<. substitute text from Clipboard[4] at this point, replacing all new-lines with spaces (to join into one line)|
(def). |<(key). @\|@|(desc)<. substitute number of terminal columns|
(def). |<(key). @\#@|(desc)<. substitute number of terminal lines|
(def). |<(key). @\"@|(desc)<. quote; allowed for legacy reasons but no longer needs escaping|

fn1. To see the octal versions of all ASCII characters,
 look at <a href="x-man-page://ascii">x-man-page://ascii</a> (opens a
 MacTerm window and runs "man ascii").  Also note that the button
 "Insert Control Key Character..." can be used to help insert the
 right code for a variety of keys.

fn2. Currently there is no way to choose which network address is actually
 sent with "\i", and the substitution may even change across different
 invocations of your macro.  It is strongly recommended that you use
 the newer form, "\I", which expands to a space-separated list of ALL
 network addresses for your computer (in an unspecified order), allowing
 you to inspect them individually and choose the most appropriate one.
 You can use Window >> Network Addresses of This Mac to see all the IP
 addresses that your computer has and drag the desired one into a
 terminal window.

fn3. If you use the @\s@, @\j@ or @\q@ sequences in a macro that has a
 name, it will *automatically appear in contextual menus* when
 text is selected in a terminal window.

fn4. If you use the @\.@ or @\:@ sequences in a macro that has a name,
 it will *automatically appear in contextual menus* when there is any
 text on the Clipboard.

h2(#workspaces). Workspaces

bq. You can create more than one set of settings in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a sidebar
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the sidebar, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main settings
 window.

bq. Settings in this category allow inheritance;
 see "About Inherited Settings" for details.

Workspaces manage multiple terminal windows on one or more
 displays.  In addition, the Default is used at startup time to
 automatically spawn zero or more windows for you.

h3. Options

h4(#usetabs). Use tabs to arrange windows

Once enabled, all new windows (but not existing ones) will be
 given tab adornments and will stick together automatically.

New windows are added to the tab group of the active window.
 A tab can be moved to a new group by clicking the up-arrow
 button on its tab, or using Window >> Move to New Workspace.

**Tip:** If you're using more than one display, or Spaces, it
 is handy to have a tab group for each space.

It is important to notice that MacTerm tabs are normal
 windows so they are independent and can be modified in the
 usual ways.  The _only_ exception is that all the windows in
 the group will move together.

If a sheet is open on one tab, you can still reach other tabs
 by clicking on them with the mouse.

You can also drag and drop between tabs: simply move the mouse
 over a tab to activate its window.

h4. Automatically enter Full Screen

If you want the session window to automatically take over a
 screen as soon as it starts, set this option.  The effect is
 the same as if you had used "Enter Full Screen" yourself.  If
 more than one window is in the Workspace then each will try
 to attempt Full Screen individually.

h3. Windows

This displays the number of windows that can be in the workspace
 (currently fixed at 10), and their names.

The names can be edited by clicking and hovering on them, or
 selecting an item and pressing Return.  Names are used to title
 the new windows that are created; leave them empty to have a
 name chosen automatically.

h3. Selected Window

To edit a window, select it from the list and then modify its
 fields in this section.  Changes take effect immediately (so,
 you could use the File menu to spawn your modified workspace).

h4. Session

The session that is started in this window.

If "None (No Window)" is selected, no window is opened at all,
 and other window-specific settings are ignored.

h4. Boundaries

This specifies where the window appears.  It can be on any
 display.

If "Use tabs to arrange windows" is set for the Workspace, then
 all of the windows in the Workspace are initially glued
 together, and the only boundaries that matter are those of the
 first window in the Workspace.  (Windows are created in the
 order they are listed in the Workspace.)

See also the "Window Stacking Origin", which applies to any new
 window that is not created as part of a Workspace.

h2(#sessions). Sessions

bq. You can create more than one set of settings in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a sidebar
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the sidebar, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main settings
 window.

bq. Settings in this category allow inheritance;
 see "About Inherited Settings" for details.

Sessions are a little like Bookmarks from your web browser.

These collections specify how to access a resource (typically a
 local or remote terminal application).  They are also used to
 define key mappings, set up vector graphics, and precisely
 control data transfers.

Note that MacTerm can also save session details to files with
 File >> Save As, though the files do not contain as many details
 as main settings do.

h3(#sessionresource). Resource

h4. Command

A Resource is actually defined entirely by its command line field,
 but some helpers are available to make it easier to produce the
 kind of command that you need.

bq. Note that even if you use a helper (such as the "Shell" button)
 to initialize a command, you are still allowed to edit the
 command further.

The "Shell" button writes a command to invoke your default shell.
 For most users this is set by the version of macOS that you
 have but MacTerm will also respect any custom shell that was
 selected by the @chsh@ Unix utility.

The "Log-In Shell" button writes a command to invoke your shell,
 but in a more controlled way (for instance, Unix environment is
 not inherited).  In most shells this will also affect how the
 shell starts so you may see slightly different behavior; for
 example, you may see a welcome message.

The "Remote Shell..." button opens the Servers panel.  Note that
 edits in the Servers panel overwrite the command line field!  To
 learn more about the Servers panel, review
 "its documentation":windows.html#serverbrowser.

It is important to note that MacTerm splits this line into
 words (on whitespace), and does not interpret *any* characters:
 not even those common to Unix shells like "~", "|" and ">".  If
 you want to run a more complex command, you can save it in a
 script for the target shell, and ask MacTerm to run the script.

h4. Terminal

Specifies the Terminals collection that will be used to set up
 the emulator for the session terminal window.  Most of the
 terminal settings can be changed while the session is running, by
 using the Terminal menu; and the set can be modified using the
 settings window.

In Unix sessions, you typically will set a "TERM" environment
 variable that is consistent with the Terminal setting.

h4. Light Mode Format / Dark Mode Format

Specifies the Formats collection(s) that will be used to set up
 the fonts and colors for the session terminal window.  You can
 change font and color settings while the session is running, by
 using the View menu; and the set can be modified using the
 settings window.

h4. Translation

Specifies the Translations collection that will be used to
 interpret characters sent to the terminal; for instance, in
 order to display the right accents on letters for words in a
 particular language.  This can be changed while the session is
 running, by using the Map menu, and the set can be modified
 using the settings window.

In Unix sessions, you typically will set a "LANG" environment
 variable that is consistent with the Translation setting.

h4. Default Macro Set

When the session terminal window first opens or is later
 reactivated, the Macros collection with this name becomes
 current automatically.  If macros are displayed in the toolbar,
 those items are switched as well.  (If you manually change the
 current macro set while the window is open, that selection
 persists instead.)

h3(#sessiondataflow). Data Flow

h4. Duplication

MacTerm can send keyboard characters directly to the terminal
 as it transmits them to a session (and also display any
 "non-printable" keystrokes as floating tags); this is known as
 local echo.

Local echoing is useful for slow connections to remote servers or
 devices, because it displays what you type immediately instead
 of waiting for the actual response.  (The floating Command Line
 in MacTerm gives a similar benefit; see the Window menu.)

Of course, this makes it possible to see every key twice: once
 when MacTerm shows it immediately, and again when the server
 finally responds.  You may be able to avoid this if the remote
 system provides a way to disable its echoing; though realize
 that the local echo is just an approximation of what the server
 response would be and it may not be exactly right.

Disable this setting most of the time, since fast processes will
 respond so quickly that there is no clear delay between hitting
 a key and seeing a result in the window.

Note that this can be set temporarily by using the menu command
 Terminal >> Local Echo.

h4. Line Insertion Delay

When you use Paste or drag-and-drop for multi-line text, the
 session may not be prepared to receive that much data at once;
 this can cause various problems for the running process.

MacTerm automatically splits these insertions into lines, and
 gives you the option of pausing for a short period of time in
 between each inserted line.  You can set the delay to zero for
 immediate insertion.

h4. Scrolling Delay

An artificial delay imposed on the emulator's data processing
 loop, to slow down the terminal.  This may help readability
 for fast-moving streams, or it may just be useful for
 emulating a user's slow connection to an application.

Note that there is also Terminal >> Suspend (Scroll Lock) and
 the associated key equivalents, to temporarily stop a command
 from displaying any more data.

h4. Capture to File

You can choose to automatically log this session to a specific
 file when it starts.  Note also that this can be done from a
 menu, File >> Begin Capture to File.

If a file with the name you choose already exists, it will be
 *automatically overwritten* by future runs of the same session.
 You can enable the "Generated name" option to have a slightly
 different file name chosen each time, based on the presence of
 special sequences:

* The @\D@ sequence is replaced by the current date, using the international standard YYYY-MM-DD format (for example, if the date were October 17, 2013 then the sequence would be replaced with "2013-10-17").

* The @\T@ sequence is replaced by the current time, using the HHMMSS format and the 24-hour clock (for example, if it were 44 seconds after 3:30 in the afternoon then the sequence would be replaced with "153044").  Note that standard time separators (:) cannot be used in file names because the OS would convert them into forward slashes for historical reasons.

* The @\\@ sequence (double backslash) allows you to insert a single backslash into a generated file's name.

All possible backslashed sequences are reserved for future use.

h3(#sessioncontrolkeys). Keyboard

You can map certain key combinations to special behaviors that
 allow control over applications and data flow.

Usually the default mappings are sufficient, however there are
 notable Unix applications (like "pine" and "emacs") that may need
 to use the default control-key mappings for something else.

Note also that the Control Keys palette allows you to enter _any_
 control key at any time, regardless of key mappings.  See the
 Window menu.

h4. Process Control

h5. Interrupt Process

Defaults to control-C (^C), the key sequence that will cause the
 application in a terminal to quit immediately if possible.

This is also in the menu bar, Terminal >> Interrupt Process.

h4. Flow Control

h5. Suspend (Scroll Lock / XOFF)

Defaults to control-S (^S), the key sequence that will cause a
 scroll lock (also known as XOFF, or "suspend transmission", or
 sending a stop signal to a Unix process).

While suspended, no new text will appear in the terminal even
 though the session remains active.  This can be useful to pause
 rapidly-scrolling displays.

This is also in the menu bar, Terminal >> Suspend (Scroll Lock),
 and is available as a toolbar item.

h5. Resume (XON)

Defaults to control-Q (^Q), the key sequence that will cause a
 scroll unlock (also known as XON, or "resume transmission", or
 sending a start signal to a Unix process).

A Resume is like an Undo for a Suspend.

This is also in the menu bar, Terminal >> Suspend (Scroll Lock),
 and is available as a toolbar item.

h4. Emacs Cursor

The Emacs text editor has its own commands for moving the cursor
 in the buffer.  You can choose to have your Mac arrow keys
 trigger the appropriate Emacs commands; this includes the effects
 of using Option and Command on arrow keys to move by larger
 increments.  For instance, in Mac text editors, you can move to
 the next word with option-right-arrow; MacTerm will cause this
 sequence to send a "forward-word" Emacs command.

h4. Emacs Meta

The Emacs text editor relies heavily on a key that is not
 available on Mac keyboards, the meta key.  However, you can ask
 MacTerm to emulate the meta key by using other keys.

h4. Delete

Specifies what a Delete keypress on your Mac keyboard will do.
 Some remote applications do not understand the default
 interpretation of Delete and can respond in odd ways (such as
 printing a "^H").  Choose between either regular Delete, or a
 Backspace.

Note that you can temporarily choose the alternate mapping by
 using shift-Delete or command-Delete in a terminal window.

Note further that MacTerm's Macros are very flexible and could
 be configured to set your own custom mapping for Delete (or many
 other keys).

h4. New Line

Since some systems or applications recognize different characters
 for end-of-line, you can specify how MacTerm sends a new-line
 (say, when pressing Return or when pasting or dragging in text
 that spans multiple lines).  When source text such as a Paste
 contains new-line markers already, those markers are replaced
 with your chosen New Line mappings below.

"CR" means "carriage return" and sends one character: ASCII code 13.
 This is most likely to be useful when connecting to a remote
 system that is running the Classic Mac OS 9 or earlier.

"CR LF" means "carriage return, line feed" and sends two
 characters: ASCII codes 13 and 10.  This is most likely to be
 useful when connecting to a remote MS-DOS or Windows system.

"CR NULL" means "carriage return, null character" and sends two
 characters: ASCII codes 13 and 0.  This is most likely to be
 useful when interacting directly with remote servers over
 certain protocols.  It is also known to be helpful on systems
 running BSD version 4.3.

"LF" means "line feed" and sends one character: ASCII code 10.
 This is most likely to be useful on Unix systems.

h3(#sessiontek). Graphics (TEK)

MacTerm is not only a terminal emulator but also a display for
 various kinds of images.  You can enable a vector graphics
 command set for a session so that, when MacTerm receives
 certain special sequences, it will automatically render the data
 as a picture instead of dumping it to the terminal screen.

h4. Command set

If you want to use vector graphics, select the command set that
 indicates the kind of graphics data the session will send.
 TEK 4105 is a more powerful protocol that support scrolling,
 colored lines, and rotated text compared to TEK 4014.

h4. PAGE clears screen

When a new vector graphics image is created (known in TEK as a
 PAGE command), it is normally put into its own window.  If you do
 not want several windows and instead want MacTerm to reuse the
 same window, enable the clear-screen option.

h2(#terminals). Terminals

bq. You can create more than one set of settings in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a sidebar
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the sidebar, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main settings
 window.

bq. Settings in this category allow inheritance;
 see "About Inherited Settings" for details.

Terminals decide somewhat technical aspects of a window, such as
 the emulation type.  Usually, you set up one or more of these
 with the help of an administrator or application documentation,
 so that MacTerm behaves correctly when you use an application
 in a terminal window.  Custom and collection Sessions can
 associate a Terminal collection with them, ensuring that these
 important settings are always made for you.

h3. Emulation

h4. Base Emulator

This selects which terminal emulator implementation in MacTerm
 will be used to interpret commands (encoded as special sequences
 in transmitted text).

h5. None ("Dumb")

A "dumb terminal" doesn't actually emulate anything, though it
 will make sure every character it receives is visible.  For
 example, the character with ASCII code 200 is printed as the
 string 200 in angle brackets, and ASCII code 27 prints as "^[".
 This is useful when communicating with certain kinds of servers,
 or when debugging commands.

Advanced users should note that MacTerm's Python interface
 lets you customize the "pretty printing" of the dumb terminal.

h5. VT100

This is an accurate emulation of Digital Equipment Corporation's
 VT100 terminal device, including its VT52 compatibility mode,
 terminal LEDs, and other less common features.

h5. VT102

Largely compatible with any system that wants a VT100, this
 device has additional capabilities like print streaming.
 MacTerm is a very good VT102 emulator.

h5. VT220

This device has additional capabilities like special keyboard
 keys and 8-bit controls.  MacTerm is a very good VT220
 emulator but it does not currently support all features, like
 user-defined keys (UDKs) and certain character set registers.

Note that in the Window menu there are commands to show VT220
 floating key palettes.  You may also find it useful to set up
 Macros for key sequences of your own; more guidance on this is
 available in the "Macros section":#macros.

h5. XTerm

Mostly a superset of VT emulators, the XTerm terminal type also
 refers to the behavior of the @xterm@ Unix terminal program.
 MacTerm supports certain standard sequences such as cursor
 movement, although mouse support is not yet implemented.  If
 you are using a highly complex terminal program, you may want
 to try both the VT220 and XTerm types to see which works best
 for now.  MacTerm's XTerm support has improved over time.

It is important to note that several XTerm features have been
 extracted into Emulation Tweaks (see below) so that they may be
 enabled while *any* terminal is active, even a base VT100.  It
 is therefore not enough to choose the XTerm base type, you must
 also enable all XTerm-related tweaks to see the most accurate
 possible results.

In addition, note that TEK vector graphics is a feature of XTerm
 that MacTerm enables separately; see "Graphics (TEK)":#sessiontek.
 You must enable TEK for a Session, it is not automatically
 handled just because you chose the XTerm type.

h4. Identity

A standard identifier for the terminal emulator's supported
 features (sometimes called an answer-back message).

Applications may rely on this to determine if they should even
 bother to send certain command sequences.  For instance, if
 you identify as "vt100", an application isn't likely to send
 commands that only a VT102 supports.

This name is suggested for you automatically when you choose
 a Base Emulator.  Note however that you may still need to
 change it depending on any Emulation Tweaks (below).

This should be reflected in the "TERM" environment variable
 on Unix-like systems, and MacTerm tries to set this for you
 when you start a local command.  For remote commands, such as
 a secure shell (SSH) session, you may have to fix this yourself!

h4. Emulation Tweaks

MacTerm allows you to customize some of the features of its
 emulators.  There are a couple of main reasons for this:

* Some applications rely on bugs in common emulators or the original devices, and won't work unless MacTerm is also buggy.

* Sometimes an environment assumes that popular features of advanced terminals are available (such as XTerm window titles) even though it is mostly dependent on a more basic terminal type like VT102.

Applications may ignore tweaks unless you also set the Identity
 to tell them that the feature is supported.  Each tweak below
 suggests an Identity that will enable it.

The tweaks currently allowed are:

h5. 24-Bit Color (Millions)

Recognizes terminal sequences specifying any combination of the
 red, green and blue components of a color, instead of relying on
 look-up tables.

This feature works in tandem with other coloring methods.  While
 it is the most flexible of any method, it is also the least
 customizable by the user.  Developers of terminal-based
 applications are encouraged to always give users a way to change
 the colors that are selected.

Terminals impose a limit on the absolute maximum number of 24-bit
 color specifications (foreground or background).  Currently this
 limit is set to 2048, which means that the 2049th unique color
 definition in a particular terminal view will replace the oldest
 definition in that view.  This trade-off ensures that the
 terminal does not have to keep track of a very large number of
 unique colors, and it saves memory.  The limit may change in the
 future.

Developers should note that MacTerm does not count the base set
 of 256 colors toward this limit.  If the required color can be
 represented using older XTerm or ANSI color table specifications,
 applications should prefer those (they require fewer terminal
 sequence bytes anyway).  Also note that users can customize the
 base 16 colors to blend more naturally with their preferred
 Format, whereas 24-bit colors may not be changed by the user.

h5. VT100

h6. Fix Line Wrapping Bug

Some applications have come to rely on text wrapping occurring
 in an idealized way, instead of how it actually is on a VT100
 device.  The typical symptom is a full-screen application that
 scrolls up one line instead of occupying the whole terminal
 gracefully.  A temporary work-around is to use the menu option
 Terminal >> Line Wrap.  This emulation tweak is not fully
 implemented.

h5. XTerm

Note that XTerm is also an emulator type of its own, that has
 additional cursor movement capabilities among other features.
 You may choose to enable or disable the following XTerm features
 whether or not you have chosen an actual XTerm as Base Emulator.

h6. 256 Colors

Enables all 256 new XTerm colors, which includes 16 "standard
 colors" that can be customized in MacTerm's Formats
 settings.  This allows an application to give text a specific
 foreground and background color, instead of relying on terminal
 defaults.

Note that this feature could significantly increase the memory
 requirements for a terminal.

For this to work, your Identity may need to be "xterm-256color"
 or a 256-color variant such as "gnome-256color".

h6. Background Color Erase

In programs such as text editors that customize terminal colors,
 this mode allows the most recent custom color to be applied to
 any erased region (for efficiency, as color settings do not
 have to be repeatedly transmitted).

This is a very important mode that is needed by many modern
 terminal-based programs so it is enabled by default.

h6. Color

Enables *only* the 16 basic colors commonly called "ANSI colors"
 or Standard Colors which can be customized in MacTerm's Formats
 settings.  This allows an application to give text a specific
 foreground and background color, instead of relying on terminal
 defaults.

For this to work, your Identity may need to be "xterm-color" or
 equivalent.

h6. Graphics Characters

Enables a special set of graphics characters, such as lines and
 symbols.  Note that Terminal >> Reset Graphics Characters is a
 special "soft reset" that turns off only the character set, in
 case an application accidentally leaves your whole window in an
 unreadable state of rendering graphics!

For this to work, your Identity may need to be "xterm" or
 equivalent.

h6. Window Alteration

Allows applications to change the title of your terminal window,
 as well as its minimized state, position, size, and other
 attributes.  This is not completely supported by MacTerm's
 daily builds yet but it will be soon.

For this to work, your Identity may need to be "xterm" or
 equivalent.

h3. Screen

Screen settings determine how much text can be stored, how much
 is visible, and how quickly it can be augmented.

**Note:** These settings are under evaluation and may move to
 other settings categories in the future.

h4. Width

The maximum number of columns of text (equivalent to characters,
 in Western locales, when in single-width) that are stored and
 visible on each line.  Currently, MacTerm won't horizontally
 scroll terminals so this is also the display width.

If a window is reduced in size, it may internally retain the
 entire original line.  A line that is made double-size will
 only display half of its capacity.

h4. Height

The maximum number of _visible_ lines of text.  This refers to
 normal size only; double-size lines implicitly occupy two lines
 out of the buffer.

If a window is reduced in size, it may completely lose the
 contents of the bottom lines that were cut off.

h4. Scrollback

It is often useful to refer back to previous text written to a
 terminal so there is an option to save it.  In addition, note
 that Terminal >> Delete Entire Scrollback Buffer can be used at
 any time during a session to wipe out the saved lines.

There are a few options available:

h5. Off

Does not save any lines, and therefore displays no scroll bar
 in the terminal.

h5. Fixed Size

Allocates no more than the given amount.  If measured in rows,
 each row might occupy as much memory as the maximum width
 requires, plus space for auxiliary data (Unicode characters,
 attributes, etc.).

h5. Unlimited

The scrollback size is dynamically allocated in progressively
 larger chunks to keep up with demand; it is never discarded.

h5. Distributed

The specified amount of space is globally shared across all
 other terminal windows that also have the Distributed setting,
 and they effectively share memory.  If a terminal hasn't been
 used in awhile, its oldest scrollback lines are recycled by
 the windows that actually are being used.

h3. Options

h4. General

h5. Wrap lines (no truncation)

If the cursor is at the end of a line and another character is
 written, this cause the cursor to automatically wrap to the
 beginning of the next line.  In addition, if this was the very
 bottom line, the content scrolls up one line.  (Certain
 terminal emulators may handle this slightly differently.)

If wrapping is disabled, the final character is simply
 obliterated each time a new character arrives, until an
 explicit new-line sequence is read or the cursor is relocated
 by the application.

This sets the default for Terminal >> Line Wrap.

h5. Do not strip high bit of bytes

Specifies that the data is 8 bits instead of 7 bits.  The
 MacTerm daily builds currently do not handle this setting
 reliably.

h5. Save lines when screen clears

If an application requests a full screen clear, this causes
 the entire content of the screen to first be copied into the
 scrollback buffer (as if it "scrolled off the top") before
 clearing the screen.

Otherwise, the screen is cleared and anything on it is lost.

This sets the default for Terminal >> Save Lines on Clear.

h4. Keyboard

h5. Normal keypad top row

Prevents the clear, =, /, and * keypad keys from being mapped
 respectively to the PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4 keys of a VT220
 terminal.

h5. Local page keys

Prevents the home, end, page up and page down keys from sending
 commands to the application running in the terminal; instead,
 they affect the local terminal display.  Specifically, a local
 "home" scrolls to the very top, an "end" scrolls to the very
 bottom, a "page up" scrolls the content down by a screenful,
 and a "page down" scrolls the content upward by a screenful.

h2(#formats). Formats

bq. You can create more than one set of settings in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a sidebar
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the sidebar, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main settings
 window.

bq. Settings in this category allow inheritance;
 see "About Inherited Settings" for details.

notextile. <a id="helpwithscreenformatting"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

Formats are collections of fonts, font sizes, colors, and more,
 that decide how your terminal windows look.  You can use the View
 menu to change a window's format to one of the collections you
 specify in the main settings, or to make customizations local to
 the frontmost window.

h3. General

Settings that apply to all text, unless overridden by some more
 specific property.

To edit most settings, click on a box and the standard system
 panel (Fonts or Colors) will appear.

Character width is normally 100% but you can choose to make the
 text cells of a terminal slightly narrower or wider (useful with
 certain fonts).  It is important to realize that if the width is
 not 100%, the renderer may have to use less optimal methods of
 placing text, which could make text scrolling noticeably slower.

Color settings have two entries, the leftmost box is the text
 (foreground) color and the rightmost box is the background color.

The terminal cursor can be set to a custom color, or you can use
 the "Automatic" check box to have the color change based on the
 text that is underneath the cursor at any given time.

MacTerm uses special versions of mouse pointers such as the
 I-beam to improve contrast (as terminals can use a wide variety
 of colors).  You can choose the primary color to use for the
 pointer when the mouse is over a terminal window.  As with any
 Format setting, this can be set in the Default Format and then
 inherited, or customized on a per-Format basis for the best look.

h3. Standard Colors

Terminal applications can rely on an ANSI standard palette of
 colors.  While it is a good idea to choose colors that match the
 specified names, sometimes you have to change them so they don't
 clash with your other customizations!

Color settings have two entries, the leftmost box is the "normal"
 version and the rightmost box is the "bold" (or emphasized) one.
 Ordinarily, the bold color is a slightly brighter version of the
 normal color.

Feel free to experiment; "Set to MacTerm Default Colors..." can be
 clicked to restore the 16 ordinary colors.

Not all applications in terminals will make use of these colors.
 In addition, a Terminal collection can disable them.

h2(#translations). Translations

bq. You can create more than one set of settings in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a sidebar
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the sidebar, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main settings
 window.

bq. Settings in this category allow inheritance;
 see "About Inherited Settings" for details.

A translation table essentially allows the terminal to display
 text the way it is supposed to, according to what an application
 in a terminal expects.

The Map menu allows you to choose among these translation
 settings while sessions are running.

h3. Settings

h4. Characters

Choose an encoding from the list to tell MacTerm how to
 interpret text while these translation settings are active.
 Typically a good value is "Unicode (UTF-8)".

h4. Options

h5. Use a backup font

Unfortunately, not all fonts are the same: some of them cannot
 render all possible characters.  A "backup font" allows you to
 *prefer* current Format settings for most text (perhaps
 because those fonts look nicer in general) but use the backup
 to handle special characters.  A Unicode font is recommended as
 a backup font.
