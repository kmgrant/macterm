h1(pagetitle). Playing BBS Games

notextile. <div class="content">

p(#abstract). While it is possible to configure MacTerm to work well with
 typical games, the defaults will not work well at all!  This
 tutorial will help you make settings appropriate for most games.

h2. Overview

Historically, many so-called BBS (Bulletin Board System) games,
 also known as MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons), expect to work on PCs
 under DOS.  They also typically rely on non-standard extensions
 to the VT100 terminal, that collectively are known as ANSI-BBS.

MacTerm's default VT100 emulator has a few of the common
 extensions that make it compatible with ANSI-BBS.  It also knows
 how to translate characters from other character sets (DOS has
 its own character set), and special graphics characters are
 rendered with high quality.

h2. Configuration

h3. Translation

First, you must create a Translation collection (via MacTerm
 settings) that uses the same characters as DOS typically does,
 such as special graphics.

* Open the MacTerm settings window, and go to the Translations pane.
* Either edit the default, or (recommended) use the "+" button in the drawer to create a new collection.
* Select "Latin-US (DOS)" from the "Characters:" list.

The list is based on what translation units are installed on your
 computer.  While the DOS set is always available on macOS when
 sold in the U.S., it may not exist in international versions.

If you acquired a translation unit in some other way, it may have
 some other name (such as, CP437 for Code Page 437).

h3. Format

While you do not have to change fonts or colors (configured in
 Format settings), you should be aware of some side effects.

One, there is currently a bug in MacTerm where any font that is
 not natively encoded as Mac Roman, may incorrectly display some
 international characters.  If your game relies on things like
 accented characters, be sure to choose a more basic font (like
 Monaco).

Two, MacTerm automatically chooses a different color for text or
 backgrounds that are considered "bold" and "blinking".  If you do
 not want this effect, you should configure the Format that you
 use to have the same colors for bold, blinking, and normal text.

Three, if you have customized any of the 16 "ANSI Colors" in a
 Format, note that games often draw graphics assuming that the
 original colors are in use.  The "Set to the Standard Colors..."
 button on the "ANSI Colors" tab of the Formats pane allows you to
 make these 16 colors return to their expected defaults for a PC.

Four, MacTerm supports up to 256 colors, but programs that may use
 them will often only attempt to do so when the terminal is
 identified as "xterm-256color".  Note that you cannot customize
 these 256 colors, except for the 16 that are in the "ANSI Colors"
 subset.  (Do not worry about 256 colors unless you know that your
 game can use them.)

h3. Terminal

You should have a Terminal set up in MacTerm settings with a "Base
 Emulator:" set to VT100.

MacTerm automatically recognizes certain ANSI-specific add-ons
 to VT100, so if a game uses them they will be handled correctly.

Note that some games assume that the screen size is 80 x 25.  If
 necessary, ensure that the screen has these dimensions.

h3. Session

Your game could be hosted anywhere, though it is typically on a
 remote server with a certain host name and port number.

If you will play this game often, you should create a new Session
 collection in MacTerm settings.  Otherwise, you could enter the same
 configuration information in the "Custom New Session" sheet.

When the Sessions pane (or sheet) is visible, you will see a
 command line field.  Either directly type in the command needed
 to reach the game or use the button "Remote Shell..." to help you
 compose a command.

The pane also has pop-up menus that will let you choose the
 Terminal, Format and Translation that you created above.  This
 causes appropriate defaults to be set before the server is even
 contacted.

Note that "environment variables" on the server side sometimes
 need to be manually synchronized with MacTerm settings.  Talk to
 a server administrator to determine if this is true in your case.

h2. Game Play

Some MacTerm features are particularly well suited to games.

The "No window close on process exit" setting prevents windows
 from immediately closing at disconnect time.  Many game servers
 display information during logout that would otherwise disappear
 immediately.

"Enter Full Screen" in the View menu lets you focus entirely on
 the game.  Depending on the current setting of "Window Resize
 Effect", this may either change the font or the terminal size;
 hold down the Option key to temporarily do the opposite as you
 enter Full Screen.

The "Command Line" window can be displayed using the Window menu.
 This allows you to type text that is only sent to the server when
 you press Return (or Enter).  It also maintains a history of the
 commands entered from that window.

The Macros pane in the MacTerm settings window can be used to create
 sets of predefined actions mapped to keys (that can then be
 enabled using the Map menu).
