h2(#vt100). General

Each application running in a terminal must be told the type of
 emulator that is in use, so that appropriate requests are sent
 when rendering.

If a program is run directly by MacTerm (such as a shell or
 "ssh"), the "TERM" variable will be preset by MacTerm to match
 the emulator selected for that window.

However, there are cases where you may have to set this yourself:

* if you ask MacTerm to change the emulator of a window
* if you connect to a remote server that has its own method for setting the terminal type (e.g. different operating system)
* if there are defects in the active emulator and you want to try a different one (e.g. downgrading from "vt102" to "vt100")

In Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems, you typically
 are running a shell where the "TERM" variable can be changed.

In most shells, you use this form:

pre. export TERM=vt100

In the "tcsh" or "csh" shell, you use this form:

pre. setenv TERM vt100

You can set "TERM" to any value that is understood by the
 applications you run in a terminal.  Usually, this matches an
 actual terminal name; common values are:

pre. vt100 vt102 vt220 xterm xterm-256color linux

But, it can also be set to other names that are considered
 compatible (more or less) with one of MacTerm's own emulators.

h2(#vt100). VT100

MacTerm has a very accurate VT100 terminal emulator, including
 the VT52 mode of the VT100.  The main flaws right now relate to
 rendering of double-sized text in certain situations.

h2(#vt102). VT102

The VT102 is almost entirely the same as the VT100, but with
 enhanced editing and printing features.  MacTerm handles the
 additional editing features, and implements some printing
 features (for instance, print-from-terminal will automatically
 generate a MacTerm print preview).  You cannot use line-by-line
 printing yet.

h2(#vt220). VT220

The VT220 is a superset of the VT100 series.  MacTerm has an
 implementation of this emulator, but in development versions it
 is largely disabled for testing.

You can use the Window menu to access key palettes for a number
 of VT220 terminal features.

h2(#vt320). VT320

The VT320 is a superset of the VT220.  MacTerm does not support
 this terminal type (yet).

h2(#vt420). VT420

The VT420 is a superset of the VT320.  MacTerm does not support
 this terminal type (yet).

h2(#xterm). XTerm

The XTerm is a superset of the VT100 series that is notable for
 window management features like minimization, size, and title, as
 well as mouse support.  MacTerm implements a number of useful
 XTerm features, *in addition to those already in the VT102*:

* 256 colors (set "xterm-256color" TERM for apps to use it)
* dynamic updates to colors
* window and/or minimized-icon titles
* cursor sequences ("CHA", "HPA", "VPA", "CNL", "CPL")
* tab stop sequences ("CHT", "CBT")
* line scrolling ("SU", "SD")
* insert and erase ("ICH", "ECH")

h2(#linux). Linux

The Linux terminal is a superset of the color XTerm.  MacTerm
 does not support the extensions from this terminal type (yet).

h2(#ansibbs). ANSI-BBS

The ANSI-BBS terminal type has many names, and is perhaps best
 described as the MS-DOS terminal.  The feature set is not
 entirely standardized, but it is known for using Code Page 437
 extended ASCII as its character set.  PC console applications
 commonly rely on this to do relatively sophisticated graphics
 rendering.  MacTerm has a very good rendering of CP437, but
 to enable it you must set up a Translation preference that
 chooses "Latin-US (DOS)" as its character set.
