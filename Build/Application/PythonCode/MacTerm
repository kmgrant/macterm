"""The main entry point to MacTerm.

This file's name must match the value of CFBundleExecutableName in "Info.plist".

The loader is set up in this file, so that a 2nd script (executed at the end) is
able to import compiled code.  Note that an alternative would have been to
install the necessary frameworks in a location that the loader already searches,
such as /Library/Frameworks; but it's nice to have all the files together, and
definitely nice when users don't need an installer or administrator privileges.
